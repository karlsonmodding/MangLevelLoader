MangLevelLoader is (as the name suggests) a level loader for Dani's itch.io release of Karlson.

INSTALLATION
You need to patch Karlson with MelonLoader (version 3.0 or higher, 4.x recommended). MelonLoader can be downloaded in this URL: https://melonwiki.xyz
After the patch is applied, copy MangLevelLoader.dll to the Mods folder and start the game.

USAGE
The mod creates a Levels folder the first time it is loaded, where levels are saved in the .mll format
In order to load a level use the "load" command with the level name as it is written on the level file as an argument.
In order to create a level you need to enter edit mode, that is done by the "edit" command; in this mode you have access to a variety of commands to edit a level, they can be found using the command "help 1".
